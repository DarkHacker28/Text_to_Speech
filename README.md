# Text_to_Speech

# Overview
This project implements a **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** system that converts input text into speech. It uses advanced speech synthesis techniques to generate natural-sounding audio output. The TTS system is designed to be simple, efficient, and easy to use, with multiple language support and customization options.

# Features
- Converts any input text to speech
- Supports multiple languages (e.g., English, Spanish, French, etc.)
- Customizable voice parameters (pitch, rate, volume)
- Save generated speech as audio files (MP3, WAV)
- Lightweight and easy to integrate into your applications

# Requirements
To run the Text-to-Speech system, you will need the following:

- Python 3.6+ (or newer)
- Required Python libraries:
  - `gTTS` (Google Text-to-Speech) for TTS synthesis
  - `pydub` for audio file handling
  - `playsound` for playing audio (optional)

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

pip install gTTS pydub playsound

Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tts-project.git

Navigate into the project folder:

cd tts-project

Install the required dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Command Line Interface (CLI)
To convert text to speech from the command line:

python tts.py "Hello, welcome to the Text-to-Speech demo!"
This will generate a speech file (output.mp3) and save it to the current directory. You can specify different voices and languages by passing additional options:


python tts.py "Bonjour, bienvenue!" --language "fr" --voice "female" --rate 1.0 --pitch 1.2
Programmatic Usage
You can also integrate this Text-to-Speech functionality into your own Python programs:

python
from tts import TextToSpeech

# Create a TTS instance
tts = TextToSpeech()

# Convert text to speech
tts.speak("Hello, this is a test of the Text-to-Speech system.")

# Save the speech to an audio file

tts.save("output.mp3")
Available Parameters
language: Language of the voice (e.g., "en", "es", "fr", "de").
voice: Voice type, either "male" or "female".
rate: Speed of the speech (float, default is 1.0).
pitch: Pitch of the speech (float, default is 1.0).
Supported Languages
Currently, the TTS system supports the following languages:

English (en)
Spanish (es)
French (fr)
German (de)
Italian (it)
Dutch (nl)
Additional languages may be supported depending on the underlying TTS engine used (e.g., Google TTS, AWS Polly).
